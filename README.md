# Quantitative Finance - Pairs Trading

In pair trading since the correlation between the two stocks is 95% these two follow a similar trend. But due to some temporary market conditions like an announcement of results in a company or due to any mishaps in another company, makes the stock direction of that company to deviate from the mean value.  <br>
Given the striking similarities between the two banks, whatever change in the business environment affects one bank, the 2nd bank should be affected in the same way.
But because of high correlation after some time, the deviated stock again try to come to the mean path. Pair trading is a market neutral strategy where when a one stock is bought, another is sold short.  <br>
We exercise this opportunity when the stock gets deviated and should enter into the trade if the standard deviation is exceeds 95%.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical operation wherein the input is an array of two sets of numbers and the output contains many different parameters, including the intercept and constant needed for constructing the straight line equation.  <br>
Linear regression analyzes two separate variables in order to define a single relationship. In price-action analysis, this refers to the variables of price and time. Quantitative traders who use charts recognize the ups and downs of price printed horizontally from day-to-day, minute-to-minute, or week-to-week, depending on the evaluated time frame. The different time frame approaches are what make linear regression analysis so attractive.  <br>
